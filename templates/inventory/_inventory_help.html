<p>Lists are collections of objects forming a common theme, such as your
    collection of retro computers your partner hates, or your collection of Mongolian tooth flossing sticks.</p>

<p>You can add a new list by clicking the <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> icon at the top. Along with the list <em>name</em>
and <em>description</em>, you can specifiy whether the list will be private (default) or allow item level visibility.
Item level visibility allows items within the list to be publically viewable. By default, items are created private.</p>

<p>The <i class="fas fa-lock"></i> icon indicates that the list is private (to you).
    The <i class="fas fa-unlock" style="color:red;"></i> indicates an list with item level visibility. </p>

<p>Items (or more precisely things) can be moved between lists from within the lists themselves. </p>

<p>In addition to user defined fields and templates, items within lists will, by default display a few default fields
    such as <em>type, location, tags</em> and <em>images</em>. If you dont want to show these on the item pages for this list you can
    turn them off on the Add or Edit list form.</p>
